    # In kubernetes 1.6 and beyond, it seems there was a change in behavior
    # requiring us to tolerate unready endpoints to form a quorum.  I can only
    # guess at some small timing change causing statefulset+2 to not see the
    # now ready statefulset+1, and because we do not tolerate unready endpoints
    # a newly provisioned ceph-mon will most certainly never see itself in the
    # peer list.  This change allows us to form a quorum reliably everytime
