  # This defines creation of ClusterRoleBindings that configure
  # default PodSecurityPolicies for the subjects below.
  # `nil` avoids creation of a default binding for the subject.

  defaults:
    serviceaccounts: psp-default
    authenticated: psp-default
    unauthenticated: nil

data:
  # Each of these corresponds to the `spec` of a PodSecurityPolicy object.
  # Note that this default PodSecurityPolicy is incredibly permissive.  It is
  # intended to be tuned over time as a default, and to be overridden by
  # operators as appropriate.
  #
  # A ClusterRole will be created for the PSP, with the same `metadata.name`.
  #
  # Note: you can define as many PSPs here as you need.
  #
  psp-default:  # This will be the `metadata.name` of the PodSecurityPolicy
