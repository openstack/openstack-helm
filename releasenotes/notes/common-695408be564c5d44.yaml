    Update default ingress classes and annotations for charts to make them implementation
    agnostic. They used to be nginx specific because we always used ingress-nginx as the most
    common choice. Ingress-nginx is deprecated and will become unmaintained in Feb/2026.

    Now for all test jobs we use HAProxy Ingress as the default implementation. However any
    other implementation can be used as far as it suppports annotations similar to
    'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target' or 'haproxy.org/path-rewrite' which are
    used in many OpenStack-Helm charts.
