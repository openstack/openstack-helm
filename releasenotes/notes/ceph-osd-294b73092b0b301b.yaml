    Add a config script to set Ceph configuration options from Helm values. In
    some cases, settings in ceph.conf are not effective and must be set via 'ceph
    config set' commands. This script is called during OSD initialization to set
    these options.

    Also, bluestore_elastic_shared_blobs=false is added to the Ceph config to work
    around https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/70390.
