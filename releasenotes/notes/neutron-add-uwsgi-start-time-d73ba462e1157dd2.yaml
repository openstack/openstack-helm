    Added uwsgi start-time configuration to neutron-api-uwsgi section. The
    start-time parameter is set to "%t" (unix time at instance startup) and is
    used by ML2/OVN for creating OVN hash ring registers per worker. This
    configuration is mandatory for proper ML2/OVN operation. See the Neutron
    documentation for more details:
