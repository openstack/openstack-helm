Please review our `documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/>`_.
For quick installation, evaluation, and convenience, we have a kubeadm

up can be found `here <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/install/developer/index.html>`_.

This project is under active development. We encourage anyone interested in
OpenStack-Helm to review our `Installation <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/install/index.html>`_
